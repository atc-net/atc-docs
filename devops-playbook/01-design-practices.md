Agile Planning is the concept of handling user/customer requirements, changes and error related corrections and be able to prioritize and plan the delivery of these in continuous timeboxed iterations, while supporting team collaboration and continuous learning.

- **Do** use an agile planning tool, that is integrated with the rest of the DevOps tools
    > *To achieve full traceability from requirement to deployed code in production, it is important to link requirements to code changes to builds and deployments in all environments. This automatically lifts the task of having change management on said environments and further documents why specific code changes were made and finally deployed to production*
- **Do** comment directly on the requirements (work items) themselves
    > *To keep decision history close and traced*
- **Consider** breaking down requirements in three layers
    > *Use a structure like: Epics->Features->PBIs->Tasks.
Have business define their vision and roadmap via Epics and Features and make teams work on PBIs and Tasks.<br/>
When defining Epics, think months of work<br/>
When defining Features think weeks of work<br/>
When defining PBIs think days of work<br/>
When defining Tasks think hours of work*
- **Do** breakdown task in sizes that can be handled in less than a day
- **Consider** having sprints (iterations) defined across teams
    > *So the same taxonomy can be used across teams. If more granular iterations are needed for a team use sub division of the common iterations (like Sprint 1 and Sprint 1\Sprint 1.1 and Sprint 1\Sprint 1.2*
