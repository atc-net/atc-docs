# Monitoring

Monitoring is the act of collecting and analyzing data to determine the performance, health, and availability of your business application and the resources that it depends on. An effective monitoring strategy helps you understand the detailed operation of the components of your application. It also helps increasing application uptime by proactively notifying about critical issues so that they can be resolved, before becoming bigger problems.
